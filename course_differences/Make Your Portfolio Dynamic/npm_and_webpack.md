Not much changed here, but it mattered. I needed to pin versions of web pack so some features didn't break during the build. See [here](https://acloud.guru/forums/serverless-portfolio-with-react/discussion/-L_xzEvexMeK21odTXLj/build_failure_in_pipeline_-_np) for more details.


From my package.json:
~~~
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.4",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.24.1",
    "webpack": "4.2.0",
    "webpack-cli": "2.0.13"
  },
